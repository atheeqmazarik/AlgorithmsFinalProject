This README.md file describes the setup and execution of our program

This program is very simple to use. It is simply a program that the user can execute. The program also contains user input, so the user must input correctly based on what the program asks.

The program asks the user to input a starting point from Nodes A to W. Inputting otherwise results in an invalid input and asks the user to input again but correctly. Inputting "exit" will result in the program quickly ending.

The data of the given graph in the assignment has been translated to a dictionary that is in the program itself.

To use the program, simply download the "algorithms-final-project" python file. From there make sure to run it on a valid Python compiler. The compiler we used is Visual Studio Code. From there, go to Run > Run without Debugging in the top of the program. Then the program will begin to run.

Thank You :)
